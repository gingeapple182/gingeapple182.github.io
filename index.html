        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Gingeapple182â€”a mature student currently studying Computer Science (Games Development) at the University of Plymouth. My journey into game development began after several years working in finance, where I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills. Inspired by a lifelong love of games and a desire to create interactive experiences, I decided to pursue my passion and transition into the games industry.<br><br>
            As someone new to the field, I'm driven by curiosity, creativity, and a commitment to continuous learning. I enjoy tackling technical challenges and collaborating with others to bring ideas to life. My portfolio showcases the projects and skills I've developed so far, and I'm excited to keep growing as a developer.<br><br>
            Some of my biggest inspirations are open-world and creative games that empower players to shape their own stories and worlds. Iâ€™m especially passionate about Respawnâ€™s Jedi series (I even have a tattoo inspired by them!), as well as Bethesda titles like <strong>Fallout 4</strong> and <strong>Skyrim</strong> for their immersive worlds and player-driven narratives. I also love creative worldbuilding games such as <strong>Timberborn</strong> and <strong>Cities: Skylines</strong>, which fuel my interest in designing interactive, impactful experiences.
