## Portfolio Review & Analysis

### Strengths

- **Consistent Branding:**  
  The color scheme, fonts, and layout are cohesive and modern. The light/dark mode toggle is a nice touch.

- **Clear Navigation:**  
  The navigation bar is simple and always visible, making it easy to move between sections.

- **Project Presentation:**  
  Projects are displayed with images, concise descriptions, and a “More Details” modal for deeper dives. External links open in new tabs, which is good UX.

- **About Section:**  
  Personal, friendly, and gives insight into your journey and inspirations.

- **Contact Page:**  
  All major platforms are linked with clear icons. Email is present (though currently disabled).

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The site adapts well to mobile and desktop screens.

### Suggestions for Improvement

#### Completeness

- **Add a Profile Image or Avatar:**  
  Even a stylized or illustrated avatar adds personality and trust.
- **Project Media:**  
  Add short demo videos or GIFs for each project if possible. This gives a quick, engaging preview.
- **Testimonials/Endorsements:**  
  If you get a client or lecturer endorsement, feature it on the homepage or project modal.
- **CV/Resume Download:**  
  Offer a downloadable PDF CV (anonymized if needed).
- **Accessibility:**  
  Ensure all images have descriptive `alt` text. Test keyboard navigation for modals and buttons.

#### Polish & Extras

- **Contact Form:**  
  Consider adding a simple contact form (with spam protection) for direct outreach.
- **Now/Currently Section:**  
  Add a small section about what you’re currently working on or learning.
- **Blog/Devlog (Optional):**  
  If you want to share your learning journey, a simple blog or devlog is a great addition.
- **Tech Stack Overview:**  
  A visual “toolbelt” or tech stack section (with icons) can quickly show your skills.
